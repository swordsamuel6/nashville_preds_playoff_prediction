This project predicts the Nashville Predators' chances of making the NHL playoffs based on their season performance. A linear regression model estimates total wins using key statistics like goal differential and away wins, predicting a 40-win season, which falls short of the 43-win playoff benchmark. A logistic regression model, optimized for precision (95.12%), predicts playoff likelihood based on home/away wins and goal differential, achieving 94.7% classification accuracy. The analysis indicates that securing 20 home wins, 22 away wins, and a goal differential of at least +14 increases the probability of making the playoffs to 75%. Away wins were found to have a stronger influence on playoff qualification than home wins. These insights can guide strategic decisions for the team and betting markets, though the model does not account for mid-season changes like injuries or trades.
